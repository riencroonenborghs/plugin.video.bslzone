# plugin.video.bslzone

## What is it?

`plugin.video.bslzone` is a video add-on for XBMC/Kodi. Its aim is to let you watch [BSLZone](http://bslzone.co.uk) videos.

## Installation

1. `git clone` this repository
2. `zip` the repository and put it somewhere where your XBMC/Kodi can find it. I highly recommend adding the version to your zip file name to avoid clashes when you update.
3. Install the zip through `Settings > Add-ons > Install from zip file`
4. Go to `Videos > Add-ons > BSL Zone` and start browsing
